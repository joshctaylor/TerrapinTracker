**Goal**\:  Have a tracker package suitable for deploying in the field April 2021. 

The catalyst for this project was project instigator Kristen Cecala’s wish to be able to track 15 Diamondback terrapins (DBT) in a South Carolina coastal study site using a modest budget. The Terrapin Tracker project’s top priority is to fulfill that wish for the spring 2021 field season. To accomplish this goal we will:
-  test reliability and performance of different antennas for the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and LoRa radio
-  test different tracker enclosures to minimize size and weight
-  add a switch so the tracker can be turned on and off once the enclosure is sealed
-  field test the tracker and data servers to ensure reliability for a multi-month deployment
-   promote the tracker within the broader turtle tracking community to attract additional researchers interested to the project.

**Status and measuring success:**
We have a working prototype but each of the components needs to be significantly refined before it can be safely and reliably deployed in the field. Success will be measured by the results of a multi-week field test with the tracker mounted on a turtle. Another metric will be the number of researchers who show interest in using a Terrapin Tracker for their work.



**Goal**\:  Develop and test a prototype tracker system that can be easily deployed in an area with no power and no WiFi connectivity. 

Our field site for the initial deployment in the spring of 2021 will have power and WiFi connectivity but we realize many tracking projects take place in areas where those resources are not available. To address that need we will develop a version of the Terrapin Tracker system that requires less power to operate, can be powered for long periods using solar energy and data can be transmitted via cellular or satellite networks. In other words, this would be a system that could be packaged and easily deployed in nearly any environment.

Status and measuring success:
At this point the project has only discussed the importance of providing this capability but no hardware to support it has been tested. Success will be measured by how close we are to being able to deploy such a Terrapin Tracker system in an off-the-grid environment. 


**Goal**\: Develop a prototype for a version 2 tracker that has a sensor to detect when a turtle shell is above or under water. 

Ideally we want to turn off the GNSS receiver when the antenna is underwater to conserve power. Our current prototype uses software logic to control how frequently the GNSS operates to acquire DBT location data. The GNSS receiver operates more frequently during high tide since that is when DBTs tend to be on land but that approach is less than ideal. Adding a sensor to detect when a DBT is underwater has been tried by other researchers and many have reported that current methods are not reliable. We will investigate novel approaches to achieve this goal.

**Status and measuring success:**
We are currently at the brainstorming stage. Success will be measured by the reliability and speed of detecting when a sensor is in or out of water. Our initial target is to be able to have the switch turn on and turn off the GNSS receiver within two seconds of a surfacing or submerging event.
